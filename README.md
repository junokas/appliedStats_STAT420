# Applied Statistics with `R` (`appliedstats`)

Textbook to accompany [STAT 420](http://catalog.illinois.edu/courses-of-instruction/stat/) at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/). Currently under active development for use in Summer 2016.

This book came to exist after [James](https://github.com/coatless) noticed me writing a bunch of RMarkdown files as notes, and told me there was a better way, `bookdown`. You can also blame him for the use of `=` as the assignment operator. So, on some level, this is all [Yihui's](https://github.com/yihui) fault.
