> "To find out what happens when you change something, it is necessary to change it."

> --- **Box, Hunter, and Hunter**, Statistics for Experimenters (1978)

- discuss exp vs prediction


```{r}
library(xtable)
fm1       = aov(tlimth ~ sex * ethnicty, data = tli)
fm1_table = xtable(fm1)
knitr::kable(fm1_table)
# figure out how to omit NAs in output
```

A/B Testing Example.

plot for pairwise comparisons, call plot on results of TukeyHSD()
link to FDR, etc.


- stat significance vs practical significance, effect size

- interaction plot




## Two-Sample t

## ANOVA

- consider moving kw to "fixes" chapter

## Multiple Comparisons

- `tukeyHSD()`
- no scheffe

## Two-Way ANOVA

## Factorial Design

## As Linear Model
